# vicco

__vicco__ is microblogging software in PHP. It’s named after [Vicco von Bülow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicco_von_B%C3%BClow).

## Features
* Pretty fast
* Web interface
* Text formatting
* Semantic HTML5 (microdata)
* Atom feed (broken)

## Target audiences
* Hackers — It’s easy to customize, so you can do what you want.
* Hipsters — It’s crappy, so you can use it as a joke and feel ironic.

## Requirements
* A web server with PHP

## Installation
1. Change the config variables in `index.php`.
2. Upload it to your server and make the directory writable.
3. Open it in your browser.
4. It should work.

## Text formatting
There is some [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)-inspired formatting. No block elements, though.

## FAQ

**Are there any dependencies? Should I use Composer?**  
What the fuck? This is literally _one_ PHP file.

**Given that you released PHP software, you know how to write PHP, right?**  
Haha, no. Basically, I stole [this script](https://github.com/lawl/b.php) with (kind of) permission and made it worse.

**Uh … well, follow-up question: Is vicco secure?**  
Probably not. Please use [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)!
